\textbf{Step 4. Authorea and Github: connection established}. TA DA! Your Authorea article and Github repo are now seamlessly linked to one another. You should see a screen that tells you that the Git access bridge was successfully set up. This means that every change made to your Authorea article \textbf{online} will automatically be reflected on the Github repository. Similarly, when you (or your coauthors) work offline on the paper and then push their changes, the online article will automatically be updated.
