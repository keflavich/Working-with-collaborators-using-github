\textbf{Step 3. Link the Authorea and Github repositories}. Go back to your Authorea document and click on the \verb|Settings| icon in the top toolbar. Then click \verb|Advanced Settings|, and scroll to the bottom and click on the Github integration button \verb|Setup a deploy key|. \textit{Note: you need to have admin privileges to see the Github integration button. Ask your first author to make you admin, if you're not.}
