\textbf{Final note}. This how-to is loosely based on a blog post by Joshua Ryan Smith called \href{http://jrsmith3.github.io/migrating-a-latex-manuscript-hosted-on-github-to-authorea.html}{Migrating a LaTeX manuscript hosted on GitHub to Authorea}. We would like to thank Josh for writing the how to manual (before we did!) and Erik for putting together the offline LaTeX build script.
