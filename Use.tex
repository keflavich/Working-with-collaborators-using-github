\textbf{Step 2. Create a Github repository}. Log in to your Github account and create a new repository. Remember to name it exactly as the Authorea document (e.g., \verb|authorea-paper-1|) and set it to the same availability (Public vs Private) as the Authorea document.

\textbf{Step 3. Link the Authorea and Github repositories}. Go back to your Authorea document and click on the \verb|Settings| icon in the top toolbar. Then click \verb|Advanced Settings|, and scroll to the bottom and click on the Github integration button \verb|Setup a deploy key|. \textit{Note: you need to have admin provileges to see the Github integration button. Ask your first author to make you admin, if you're not.} 

A screen appears with a number of technical options. What matters to you is at the very top. Click on \verb|Do this automatically|.
